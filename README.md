# Advent of Code

Usage: 
- Copy main.rs.disabled from a days folder to src/main.rs
- cargo build --release
- time target/release/advent.exe <src/dayX/input

My IDE doesn't like having multiple rust files in scope unless I declare them as modules, and that's not needed since
its dead code. My workaround is to name them x.disabled so the IDE ignores them.

On day 5 or 6 I spent over my alotted time and consulted reddit for the solution, otherwise its just me and Gemini
learning Rust together.

I'm very happy with how day 10 turned out. Day 9 on this computer is incomplete I will fix later.
